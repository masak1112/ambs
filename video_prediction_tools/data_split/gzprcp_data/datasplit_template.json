# NOTE: This json-file should not be processed and simply serves as an exemplary file to configure the datasplit for kth human action dataset.
#       If you would like to generate your own datasplit config file, you may copy this template and modify it to your personal needs.
#       However, remember to remove any comment lines (starting with #) from your config-file then!!!
#
# Explanation: In the following, the data is splitted based on the index, each index has a list with two elements which are the start and end indices of the 
#              raw dataset
#              Be aware that this is a prue data file, i.e. do not make use of any Python-functions such as np.range or similar here!
