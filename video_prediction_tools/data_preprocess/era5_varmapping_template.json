# Explanation: In the following, the mapping of known variable names from the ERA5-data (grib2-files) is defined
#              The keys of the dictionary 'surface' (for 2D surface varibales) denote the variable names
#              in the target netCDF-file while the values denote the name of the variable in the ERA5 grib file.
#              For the dictionary 'multi' (used for 3D variables), the keys denote both,
#              the variable name in the target netCDF-file and in the ERA5 grib file.
#              The value of the 'pl'-key denotes the pressure level (in Pa) onto which the data is interpolated
#              !!! This file should be only adapted if you are familiar with the ERA5 grib files!!!
